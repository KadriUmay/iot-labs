## Lab 2 Environmental Sensor ##

A Smart Home revolves around the idea that unattended sensors can report on ambient conditions in a home in the homeowners absence. A typical requirement for this is to measure the home environment and to react to this and work to alter the environment to the homeowners wishes. For instance, if the temperature drops below a threshold then a heating system may be activated.

In order to implement this, it is possible to take consumer equipment and combine it in a good approximation of how commercial equipment may work. For instance, it is possible to use the **Arduino** hobbyist electronics boards and standardised components to measure temperature
